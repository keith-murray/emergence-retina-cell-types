# Emergence of direction-selective retinal cell types in task-optimized deep learning models

## What is thie repo?

This repository contains the code for my paper "Emergence of direction-selective retinal cell types in task-optimized deep learning models". All code is writen in Python and deep learning models are coded in PyTorch.

This was my first project using deep learning to model a neural circuit. I don't believe that the code would still work, but in fairness, there are a few clever tricks that someone might find useful. Check out the `retina_model.py` script to see how I used `exec` functions to flexibly create different combinations of retinal circuits.

In my current projects, I take a lot of direction from [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev) to ensure the readability and longevity of my projects. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I learned a lot, but this code is more nostalgic than anything else.
